AVR with Nokia FBUS
=============

This code connects an AVR atmega88 with a Nokia 3310 mobile phone and any NMEA-compliant GPS receiver, to create a cheap GPS tracker. Send it an SMS, and it will reply with its current GPS coordinates.

By using scavenged parts, the cost of this project can be very low. I bought one for about $5 online (actually I splurged and got a wall charger for an additional $0.50). These phones (Nokia 3310/6110) are what suicide bombers put into their vests, because they're essentially disposable and very easy to interface with.
